# GigGrove

**GigGrove** is a freelancing platform designed to create a trustless environment for clients and workers through the use of escrow contracts. This ensures that payments are securely held until the agreed-upon work is completed, offering both parties peace of mind.

## Features

- **Escrow Contracts**: Funds are securely held in escrow until the project is completed, ensuring trust between clients and workers.
- **Client and Worker Dashboards**: Separate portals for clients and workers to manage projects, tasks, and payments.
- **Contract Management**: Both parties can create, view, and sign contracts based on templates to formalize their agreements.
- **TurboRepo**: Monorepo structure with three apps (client, worker, backend) to maintain scalability and a streamlined development process.

## Project Structure

This project is a **TurboRepo** that contains the following apps:

1. **Client App**: Frontend for clients to post jobs, manage contracts, and handle payments.
2. **Worker App**: Frontend for workers to browse jobs, accept contracts, and submit work.
3. **Backend**: API that powers both the client and worker apps, manages contract and payment workflows, and handles authentication.
